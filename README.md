# Code showcase

Max Campbell

## The Motivation

The purpose of this repository is to showcase my coding skills to potential collaborators and employers. Naturally, I have written a lot of code that is private and belongs to various organisations. This repository holds some examples of chunks of code that I have written. The primary language that I have written code in is [R](https://github.com/maxcampb/Code_showcase/R_code), however, I intend to add some examples in other languages in the future. My key coding skills are:

* Functional programming
* Data wrangling and working with different complex data structures (including lists, matrices/arrays, vectors, data frames, s3 and s4 objects in R)
* Working with times and dates
* Strings and pattern matching
* Parallel processing
* Vectorisation (including apply and map functions)
* For loops, if statements, switch statements, and indexing
* Debugging
* Metaprogramming (using code to write code)
* R shiny
* Multiplot data visualisation (ggplot2, base plot, gridExtra, matplotlib, seaborn)

The key packages I use are base R, tidyverse, mgcv, lme4, purrr, ggplot2, rlang, parallel and nlme.
